## Bronze Script Analysis (via 纯)

### Historical Forms Evidence

**纯 (pure/simple) forms documented**:
- **Oracle bone**: NONE (no oracle bone attestation)
- **Bronze inscriptions**: 3 forms (B18214-B18216)
- **Seal script**: 1 form (S09564)
- **Liushutong**: 9 variant forms (L05281-L05284, L31408-L31412)

**Original meaning of 纯**: "Meaning simple" (本义)

**Observation from bronze forms**:
The bronze forms show 纟(silk) + 屯, but the pictographic origin of 屯 in bronze is challenging to interpret from the forms alone.

**Key question**: What does 屯 depict that contributes to "simple" when combined with silk (纟)?

Possible interpretations:
1. **Single/unified thread**: 屯 = single, concentrated → 纯 = simple, pure silk (not mixed)
2. **Gathered/coiled**: 屯 = gathered/stored → 纯 = silk wound up simply/neatly?
3. **Sprouting** (traditional): Less clear how sprout → simple

**Critical insight needed**: Without oracle bone forms for 屯 itself, we rely on character network patterns and user's interpretation of bronze forms.

## Initial Semantic Pattern Observations (Zinets Verified)

### Pronunciation Patterns

**tún readings:**
- 屯 (garrison/store), 囤 (hoard/store), 軘 (wheel hub), 黗 (black), 肫 (gizzard)

**dùn/dǔn readings:**
- 钝 (blunt), 吨 (ton), 沌 (chaos), 顿 (pause/arrange), 庉 (building), 盹 (doze)

**chún readings:**
- 纯 (pure/simple), 杶 (tree)

**cūn readings:**
- 邨 (village)

**zhūn readings:**
- 屯 (difficult - alternate), 窀 (bury), 肫 (gizzard/sincere), 軘 (wheel)

**Note**: Strong phonetic component (tún/dùn/chún dominate), but semantic patterns need investigation

### Preliminary Semantic Clusters

**STORAGE/GATHERING cluster:**
- **屯** (garrison = gather troops; store = accumulate goods) ✓✓✓
- **囤** (store grain, hoard, storage bin) ✓✓✓
- **邨** (village = gathering of dwellings) ✓✓
- Pattern: Accumulation, gathering, storage

**SIMPLICITY/PURITY cluster:**
- **纯** (pure, simple - original meaning) ✓✓✓
- Paradox: How does storage/gathering → simple/pure?

**DULLNESS/SLOWNESS/DIFFICULTY cluster:**
- **钝** (blunt, dull, slow-witted)
- **盹** (doze, drowsy state)
- **沌** (chaos, turbid - 混沌 primordial chaos)
- **屯** (zhūn reading = difficult)
- **窀** (bury - connected to difficulty/end?)
- Pattern: Lack of sharpness, clarity, or ease

**PAUSE/ARRANGEMENT cluster:**
- **顿** (pause, stop; arrange, put in order)
- Relates to both difficulty (pause = obstruction?) and organization?

**SETTLEMENT cluster:**
- **邨** (village)
- **庉** (building/shelter)
- Pattern: Fixed dwelling places where people gather/store

### Critical Observations

1. **The STORAGE meaning of 屯 is very strong:**
   - 屯 (store up, garrison troops)
   - 囤 (hoard grain, storage bin) - directly uses 屯 + enclosure
   - 邨 (village - where people/goods gather)
   - This seems to be the PRIMARY semantic thread

2. **纯 (pure/simple) is PARADOXICAL:**
   - Original meaning = "simple" (本义)
   - How does 纟(silk) + 屯(storage?) = simple/pure?
   - Possible: **Single unified thread** (not mixed/complex)?
   - OR: **Concentrated essence** (stored/accumulated purity)?
   - CRITICAL CHARACTER for understanding 屯

3. **The "difficulty/dullness" cluster:**
   - 屯 (zhūn) = difficult
   - 钝 = blunt (not sharp - difficult to cut)
   - 沌 = chaos (undifferentiated - not clear)
   - 盹 = drowsy (not alert)
   - Could relate to: **Undifferentiated/unformed state**?
   - Like primordial chaos (混沌) before creation?

4. **Two possible core meanings:**
   - **A: Gathering/Storage/Accumulation** (tún reading, material)
   - **B: Undifferentiated/Simple/Unified** (relates to chaos, simple, blunt)

5. **Could these be RELATED?**
   - Stored/gathered things → accumulated mass → undifferentiated lump?
   - Simple = not divided/separated = unified whole?
   - Sprout (traditional) = concentrated life force before differentiation?

### Working Hypotheses (TENTATIVE - need user insight)

**Hypothesis A: "GATHERING/STORAGE/ACCUMULATION"**
- Core: 屯 = to gather, store, accumulate
- Explains: 屯 (store/garrison), 囤 (hoard), 邨 (village)
- Problems: Doesn't clearly explain 纯 (simple) or 钝 (blunt)

**Hypothesis B: "UNDIFFERENTIATED/UNIFIED/SIMPLE"**
- Core: 屯 = unified whole, not yet divided/differentiated
- Explains: 纯 (pure/simple silk), 沌 (primordial chaos), 钝 (blunt = no sharp edge)
- Problems: Harder to connect to storage/garrison meanings

**Hypothesis C: "CONCENTRATED MASS" (combines A + B)**
- Core: 屯 = concentrated/gathered into unified mass
- Stage 1: Gathering/accumulation (tún)
- Stage 2: Concentrated undifferentiated state
- Explains:
  - 屯 (store = gather into mass)
  - 囤 (hoard = accumulate into concentrated store)
  - 纯 (simple = concentrated essence, pure/unmixed)
  - 钝 (blunt = thick mass without sharp edge)
  - 沌 (chaos = undifferentiated concentrated mass)
  - 邨 (village = concentrated dwelling place)

**Hypothesis D: "SPROUT/BUD" (traditional)**
- Core: 屯 = seed/sprout pushing through soil
- Concentrated life force emerging with difficulty
- Explains difficulty (zhūn) = resistance
- Explains gathering (tún) = concentrated growth
- Need oracle bone verification

### Preliminary Questions

1. **What is the pictographic origin of 屯?**
   - Traditional views: sprout breaking through soil? Troops encamped?
   - Need oracle bone forms for clarity

2. **Is there a unified semantic thread?**
   - 屯 means: garrison, store up, difficult
   - Characters show: pure, blunt, chaos, pig, stew
   - What connects these meanings?

3. **The "difficulty/obstruction" meaning:**
   - 屯 (zhūn) = difficult
   - 迍 = difficulty in travel
   - 钝 = blunt (not sharp - difficult to cut?)
   - Is difficulty/resistance a core meaning?

4. **The "accumulation/gathering" meaning:**
   - 屯 (tún) = store up, garrison (gather troops)
   - 豚 = pig (accumulates flesh/fat?)
   - 纯 = pure (accumulated/concentrated essence?)
   - Is gathering/accumulation core?

5. **Sprout hypothesis:**
   - Traditional: 屯 shows sprout breaking through soil
   - Difficulty = resistance of soil to sprout
   - Garrison = plants taking root/establishing
   - Store = accumulated growth
   - Need oracle bone evidence

**Semantic coherence**: UNCLEAR - need oracle bone evidence

**Intriguing patterns**:
- Difficulty/obstruction theme
- Accumulation/gathering theme
- Need oracle bones to determine which is primary

**Critical need**: Zinets dictionary verification and oracle bone forms

## Notes

- This analysis follows the methodology established in `semantic-radicals-v0.1.md`
- Must meet all 5 criteria: irreducibility, productivity, material culture grounding, semantic coherence, cultural salience
- **CRITICAL**: Cannot proceed with serious hypothesis until Zinets data and oracle bone forms provided
- Awaiting user's physicist insight into oracle bone pictography
