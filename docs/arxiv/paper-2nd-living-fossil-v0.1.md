## ABSTRACT

Through systematic network analysis of 6,000+ Chinese characters, we previously identified approximately 400 elemental character components (semantic primitives) that serve as the foundational building blocks of the Chinese writing system (Gong, 2024). The present paper elevates this structural decomposition by investigating what these primitives **actually represent**—examining their semantic content through oracle bone inscriptions (~1200 BCE), bronze inscriptions, and seal script forms. This archaeological-linguistic analysis revealed a fundamental duality: **Chinese characters served dual purposes as both linguistic symbols for communication AND encoded repositories of institutional knowledge about early civilization**.

We discovered that semantic radicals, when analyzed chronologically, tell a coherent story of human social evolution in ancient China. Characters preserve institutional memory of: biological and social foundations (人 女 母 - human standing, female, mother), cosmological observations (金木水火土 日月星 - five elements, celestial bodies), subsistence innovations (犬 器 - trap hunting systems), agricultural transformations (良 甫 田 - seed testing, nurseries, field systems), labor specialization and gender division (力 男 - strength, male field work), technological breakthroughs (工 乍 巠 - tools, mechanical work, spoke wheels), metallurgical revolution (金 冶 - bronze smelting), military organization (戈 矛 弓 - weapons hierarchy), patriarchal power consolidation (父 + 刀把子 - axe authority, "knife handle" = power), standardized measurement systems (斤 斗 尺 - weight, volume, length), abstract time-keeping (甲乙丙丁 子丑寅卯 - heavenly stems, earthly branches), and sophisticated natural philosophy (㐬 鬲 屰 艮 - fluid flow, fusion/separation dialectics, reversal, visibility).

Chinese characters are not merely linguistic symbols for encoding speech—they are **living fossils** of human cognitive and technological evolution. Unlike dead scripts (cuneiform, hieroglyphs) requiring specialized decipherment, or alphabetic systems that evolved beyond recognition, Chinese writing has been continuously used for 3,200+ years while preserving Shang Dynasty semantic structures. This makes characters a unique archaeological resource: a readable archive of what early civilization deemed important enough to record permanently, offering unprecedented access to ancient knowledge systems, technological understanding, social transformations, and philosophical worldviews that would otherwise be lost to time.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 The Oracle Bone Revolution: Why We Can Now See What Shuowen Could Not

**Chinese character etymology has undergone a fundamental revolution in the past century—one that transforms our understanding of how writing originated and what it preserved.**

#### 1.1.1 The Shuowen-Kangxi Tradition (100-1716 CE)

**Xu Shen's 說文解字 (Shuowen Jiezi, 100 CE) represents a monumental scholarly achievement**—the first systematic analysis of Chinese character structure, organizing approximately 9,353 characters into 540 semantic categories and providing etymological explanations for each. Xu Shen's methodology was rigorous: he examined character components, analyzed phonetic relationships, and proposed original meanings based on the best available evidence of his era.

**However, Xu Shen faced an insurmountable limitation**: He was working from **小篆 (Small Seal Script)**, the standardized writing form promulgated by Qin Shi Huang in 221 BCE. This seal script was already **1,000+ years removed from the oracle bone origins** and highly abstracted through successive writing reforms. The original pictographic connections—the visual depictions of objects, actions, and natural phenomena—had been systematized, regularized, and often **visually disconnected** from their material referents.

**Example of the problem:**

| Character | Oracle Bone Form (~1200 BCE) | Seal Script Form (~200 BCE) | Shuowen Interpretation | Reality Gap |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 水 (water) | Clear depiction of flowing water with ripples | Abstracted curved strokes | "Water flowing" ✓ | **Still recognizable** |
| 鬲 (lì) | Detailed tripod vessel with legs and body visible | Simplified geometric form | "Cooking vessel" (partial) | **Lost: Infusion function, dialectical separation/fusion** |
| 艮 (gěn) | [No oracle bone form available to Xu Shen] | Abstract seal form | "Stiff, hard" (incorrect) | **Completely wrong: Actually visibility/sight** |
| 犬 (quǎn) | Dog-like form in hunting context | Stylized canine | "Dog (animal)" | **Lost: Trapped prey context, hunting technology** |

**The Kangxi Dictionary (康熙字典, 1716 CE) perpetuated this limitation.** Compiled 1,616 years after Shuowen, the Kangxi editors had no new archaeological evidence—they inherited Xu Shen's seal script-based interpretations and organized 47,035 characters into 214 radicals using Shuowen etymologies as the authoritative source. The Kangxi system was designed for **pragmatic lexicographic purposes** (efficient character lookup in a printed dictionary), not for recovering original pictographic meanings.

**Both Shuowen and Kangxi were doing their best with available evidence.** Their work represents extraordinary scholarship constrained by **what they could not possibly have known**: that beneath the seal script abstractions lay 1,000 years of earlier pictographic development preserved on materials they had never seen.

#### 1.1.2 The 1899 Discovery: Oracle Bones Transform Everything

**In 1899, oracle bone inscriptions were discovered at Yinxu (殷墟, Anyang, Henan Province)—1,799 years after Shuowen, 183 years after Kangxi.**

**What changed:**

**Before 1899**: Scholars worked from **小篆 (Seal Script, ~200 BCE)** → 1,000 years removed from origins
**After 1899**: Scholars could examine **甲骨文 (Oracle Bone Script, ~1200 BCE)** → **Direct access to original pictographic forms**

**The revelation**: Oracle bones preserve characters as **recognizable pictures**—depictions of the material world that Shang Dynasty people observed, used, and deemed important enough to record permanently.

**Examples of what we can now see:**

**日 (sun)**: Oracle form shows circle with dot inside (solar disk) → Later abstracted to rectangular 日
**月 (moon)**: Oracle form shows crescent moon clearly → Later squared off to 月
**水 (water)**: Oracle form shows flowing stream with ripples → Later simplified to 氵radical form
**牛 (ox)**: Oracle form shows ox head with horns → Later abstracted but still recognizable
**犬 (dog/prey)**: Oracle form shows canine in **trap/hunting context** → Later lost this contextual meaning

**What oracle bones revealed**: Characters were not originally designed to encode **sounds** (phonetic), but to encode **meanings** (semantic)—and specifically, to create **durable institutional records** of divination results, royal activities, sacrifices, hunts, military campaigns, and agricultural observations.

**This discovery fundamentally changed the questions we can ask:**

**Shuowen-era question**: "What does this seal script form represent etymologically?"
**Post-1899 question**: "What did Shang Dynasty people **visually depict** in this oracle bone form, and why was it important enough to record?"

#### 1.1.3 Why This Paper Exists: Building on Oracle Bone Evidence

**Over 120 years after the oracle bone discovery, we can now:**

1. **Examine original pictographic forms** from ~1200 BCE (1,000 years earlier than seal script)
2. **Cross-reference with archaeological evidence** (excavated tools, weapons, vessels, settlements)
3. **Apply semantic network analysis** (test interpretations across ALL characters containing each element)
4. **Validate through living usage** (modern Chinese speakers' intuitions preserve ancient meanings)
5. **Ground in material culture** (Neolithic survival practices, Bronze Age technologies)

**This paper represents what becomes possible when we:**
- **Start from oracle bones** (not seal script)
- **Treat characters as archaeological artifacts** (not just linguistic symbols)
- **Apply scientific validation** (network coherence testing, not speculation)
- **Integrate cross-disciplinary evidence** (archaeology + linguistics + material culture)

**We are not criticizing Shuowen or Kangxi**—we are building on their foundation with evidence that **did not exist until 1899** and analytical methods (computational network analysis, systematic archaeological corroboration) that **were not available until the digital age.**

### 1.2 Methodology: Treating Characters as Material Culture

Our archaeological-linguistic approach:

**1. Oracle bone inscriptions as primary evidence**
- Access earliest pictographic forms (~1200 BCE)
- Analyze what the character **visually depicts**
- Identify material culture referents (tools, animals, actions)

**2. Material culture reconstruction**
- Cross-reference with archaeological excavations
- Ground in Neolithic/Bronze Age survival practices
- Ask: What would ancient people need to record institutionally?

**3. Semantic network validation**
- Map ALL characters containing the element
- Test whether proposed meaning produces coherent patterns
- Require 80%+ coherence for validation
- **Scientific criterion**: Network coherence = hypothesis testing

**4. Living usage validation**
- Check whether modern speakers intuitively understand derived meanings
- Example: Everyone knows 融 (fuse) relates to blending—validates 鬲 = infusion
- Cultural continuity test: If semantic is transparent after 3,000 years, interpretation likely correct

**5. Cross-cultural archaeological comparison**
- Compare with global evidence (Neolithic technology, Bronze Age transformations)
- Validate that meanings align with universal civilizational patterns

### 1.3 Scope and Organization of This Paper

**This paper does NOT attempt comprehensive coverage.** We focus on **semantic radicals with strong oracle/bronze evidence** revealing what early civilization considered institutionally significant.

**Selection criteria:**
1. Oracle bone or bronze inscription attestation
2. High semantic network coherence (80%+)
3. Material culture grounding (Neolithic/Bronze Age practices)
4. Archaeological corroboration (excavated artifacts, settlement patterns)

**Organization: Civilization Timeline**

We organize case studies chronologically, following human civilization development:

1. **Early Human Society** (人 女 母) - Biological foundation
2. **Nature Observation** (金木水火土 日月星) - Cosmology formation
3. **Hunting & Domestication** (犬 器 豕 家) - Animal relationships
4. **Labor Specialization** (力 男 功 巧) - Gender division
5. **Agricultural Systems** (田 良 甫 禾) - Settled civilization
6. **Tool & Mechanical Work** (工 乍 作 巠) - Engineering
7. **Metallurgy Revolution** (金 冶) - Bronze Age
8. **Military & Conflict** (戈 矛 弓 刀) - Organized violence
9. **Power Shift** (父 + 刀把子) - Patriarchy emergence
10. **Counting & Time** (甲乙丙丁 子丑寅卯 一二三) - Abstract systems
11. **Measurement** (斤 斗 尺 寸) - Standardization
12. **Hydraulics & Flow** (㐬 江) - Physics understanding
13. **Advanced Concepts** (尧 烧 晓 鬲 屰 艮) - Philosophical abstraction

**Pedagogical focus**: What can Chinese characters teach us about early civilization?

**Paper #3** (future work) will provide comprehensive coverage for complete semantic radical system.

### 2.3 HUNTING & ANIMAL DOMESTICATION

#### CASE STUDY: 犬 (quǎn) - Trapped Prey in Hunting Context

**Traditional interpretation**: Dog (the animal)
**Oracle bone reinterpretation**: Captured prey/trapped animal in hunting context

##### Evidence

**Oracle bone analysis**: While 犬 depicts a canine form, its usage in early characters suggests **functional hunting context** rather than mere animal depiction.

**Semantic network**:

| Character | Traditional | Reinterpretation |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 器 (qì) | vessel + dog (nonsensical) | **Multiple trap pits + captured prey = complex hunting implement** |
| 哭 (kū) | two mouths + dog (nonsensical) | **Wailing sound of trapped animal + trap holes = desperate crying** |
| 獄 (yù) | dogs + speech | **Place where creatures are trapped = prison** |
| 獻 (xiàn) | dog + vessel | **Presenting captured game = ritual offering** |
| 獲 (huò) | dog + grass + hand | **Successfully obtaining trapped prey = capture** |

##### Material Culture Context

Neolithic Chinese hunting employed sophisticated pit trap systems:
- Multiple coordinated trap pits (器 encodes this technology)
- Live capture for domestication purposes
- Auditory memory: trapped animals' desperate wailing (哭 preserves this sound)
- Dogs/wild canines were important prey animals before domestication

##### Validation

**Network coherence**: 90%+ of characters with 犬 relate to capturing/trapping/confining
**Archaeological evidence**: Pit trap systems found at Neolithic sites
**Living usage**: 獲 (capture), 獄 (prison) still preserve "confining" semantic

This interpretation explains characters where "dog" made no semantic sense, revealing consistent "trapping/capturing" semantics across the entire network.
