## NOTES FOR YOUR REVIEW

**Oracle Bone Attestation - UPDATED:**
- ✅ Primitive radicals: All have oracle bone or bronze/seal attestation
- ⚠️ Fire compounds (炒 灯 烘 伙 灭 灾): Compositional characters for pedagogical accessibility
- ✅ 陶 and 鬲 REMOVED per user request (fire precedes pottery)
- ✅ 城 REPLACED with 市 (structurally simpler)

**Educational Value:**
- 衣食住行 framework is pedagogically perfect for native + 2nd language learners
- Ritual characters (卜 示 祭 鬼 灵) tell the story of oracle bones themselves - reflexive!
- Fire compounds (炒 灯 烘 伙 灭 灾) demonstrate compositional logic - accessible for beginners
- **106 characters** provides comprehensive foundational coverage without overwhelming students

**Key Pedagogical Decisions (Per User):**
1. ✅ **Fire repetition intentional**: 火 appears in both Nature Observation AND Fire & Cooking to emphasize importance
2. ✅ **Removed complex characters**: 烹 煮 (too complex) replaced with simple fire compounds
3. ✅ **Fire precedes pottery**: Logical chronological ordering (fire mastery → ceramic firing)
4. ✅ **Structural simplicity**: 市 (market) instead of 城 (walled city)

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Character list finalized - ready for implementation
2. Draft new category sections (Fire, Textile, Shelter, Pottery, Ritual)
3. Update organization list in Section 1.3
4. Update figures-config.yaml with new characters
5. Renumber all sections after insertions (2.3 → 2.8 due to 5 new categories)
