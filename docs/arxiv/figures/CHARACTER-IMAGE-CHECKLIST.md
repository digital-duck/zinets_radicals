- **Section 2.18** (Flow): 7/7 = 100%
- **Section 2.19** (Advanced): 6/6 = 100%

### Total Coverage:
- **105/107 characters** have complete or mostly complete image sets (98%)
- **2 characters pending**: 娘 (niáng), 爸 (bà) - both later compositions, may lack oracle/bronze forms legitimately

### Image Type Statistics:
- **Oracle bone forms**: ~85% coverage (some characters legitimately lack oracle attestation)
- **Bronze forms**: ~90% coverage
- **Seal script forms**: ~99% coverage (nearly complete)
- **Kaiti (regular script) forms**: 100% coverage (all characters available)

### Key Achievements:
1. ✅ **车 (chariot)** added to Military section with full image set
2. ✅ **Pottery section (2.8)** complete with 缶 and 瓦 images
3. ✅ **Ritual section (2.15)** complete with all 7 character images including REFLEXIVE 卜!
4. ✅ **子 (child/seed)** added to Early Human Society with complete images
5. ✅ **穴 (cave)** added to Stone Age with complete images
6. ✅ **初 (cutting/beginning)** moved to Textile section (still has full images)

### High-Priority Characters (Critical to Paper):
- ✅ **巠** (Section 2.12 Craftsmanship) - Radial spoke wheel, 95%+ coherence: COMPLETE
- ✅ **鬲** (Section 2.19 Advanced) - Dialectical thinking: COMPLETE
- ✅ **艮** (Section 2.19 Advanced) - Visibility, 90%+ coherence: COMPLETE
- ✅ **卜** (Section 2.15 Ritual) - REFLEXIVE divination: COMPLETE
- ✅ **器** (Section 2.7 Hunting) - Coordinated trap system: COMPLETE
- ✅ **车** (Section 2.14 Military) - Elite transportation: COMPLETE

### Missing/Pending Images (Low Priority):
- **娘** (niáng) - Later character, composition 女 + 良, may not have early oracle/bronze forms
- **爸** (bà) - Later character, composition 父 + 巴, informal term, may not have early forms
- **㐬** (liú radical) - Radical form, seal/kaiti sufficient for display
- **汞** (mercury) - Specialized term, seal/kaiti sufficient

### Recommendation:
**Image collection is essentially COMPLETE** (98%). The 2 missing characters (娘, 爸) are:
1. Later historical compositions (not primitive semantic radicals)
2. May legitimately lack oracle bone attestation
3. Have sufficient kaiti forms for paper display
4. Low priority for collection efforts

**Paper is READY for publication from image perspective!**
