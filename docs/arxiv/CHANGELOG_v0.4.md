# Changelog: v0.3 → v0.4

**Date:** December 1, 2025

## Major Additions

### 1. ✅ Added Section 3.3 "Character Composition as Cognitive/Causal Modeling"
**Lines:** 1908-2047

This new section elevates the paper's intellectual contribution from "archaeological etymology" to "cognitive archaeology." Key subsections:

#### 3.3.1 Physical Causation
- 江 (jiāng): Water as active agent performing work (proto-Newtonian mechanics)
- 汞 (gǒng): Anomalous material categorization (liquid metal)
- 冶 (yě): Thermodynamic control in smelting
- 男 (nán): Labor specialization as defining feature

#### 3.3.2 Social/Economic Relationships
- 家 (jiā): Domestication as civilization marker
- 好 (hǎo): Reproductive success as value foundation
- 妇 (fù): Gender labor division
- 器 (qì): Engineering as social organization

#### 3.3.3 Abstract Causation: Technology → Value Pathway
- 良 (liáng): Agricultural technology → abstract quality
- 文 (wén): Cutting → organization → culture
- 工 (gōng): Tool operation → abstract labor concept

#### 3.3.4 Compositional Logic as Preserved Analytical Framework
Evidence for deliberate analytical modeling vs. passive labeling

**Key Argument:** Characters don't just record observations—they preserve **analytical reasoning frameworks** showing how ancient people decomposed reality into causal mechanisms.

### 2. ✅ Added "Building Upon Traditional Scholarship"
**Lines:** 1655-1661

Diplomatic acknowledgment of Xu Shen's 說文解字 (100 CE) and Kangxi Dictionary (1716 CE):
- Acknowledges Six Principles (六書) remain methodologically sound
- Emphasizes limitation was evidentiary (no oracle bones), not intellectual
- Frames work as "building upon tradition with new evidence"
- Provides examples: 艮 and 犬 reinterpretations
- Improves reception for East Asian academic audiences

---

### 3. ✅ Added Section 2.3 "Stone Age Technology - Primitive Civilization"
**Lines:** 367-449

New chronological section inserted before Hunting & Domestication, covering:

#### Characters included:
- 石 (shí) - Stone, rock (fundamental material)
- 岩 (yán) - Cliff, rock formation (natural sources)
- 矿 (kuàng) - Mine, ore (systematic extraction)
- 斫 (zhuó) - Cut, chop (stone working technique)
- 破 (pò) - Break, shatter (destructive force)
- 砍 (kǎn) - Hack, chop, fell (cutting action)
- 泵 (bèng) - Pump (hydraulic infrastructure)

#### Content structure:
- **(1) Background:** Stone Age technology (Paleolithic-Neolithic), lithic engineering, material properties
- **(2) Semantic Networks:** Table 2.3 with 石 network (200+ chars, 90% coherence) and 斫 network (15+ chars, 85% coherence)
- **(3) Oracle/Bronze/Seal Forms:** Figure 2.3 with evolution images
- **(4) Validation:** Table 2.3b with archaeological corroboration (jade working, stone molds, Liangzhu culture)

#### Key insights:
- Stone technology preceded and enabled metallurgy
- Jade working demonstrates advanced Neolithic sophistication (Mohs 6-7 hardness)
- Stone molds for bronze casting show transitional technology
- Material properties encoded through systematic semantic networks

### 4. ✅ Section Renumbering
All sections after Stone Age (2.3) renumbered:
- Old 2.3 Hunting → New 2.4 Hunting
- Old 2.4 Cutting → New 2.5 Cutting
- Old 2.5 Agricultural → New 2.6 Agricultural
- Old 2.6 Power Shift → New 2.7 Power Shift
- Old 2.7 Craftsmanship → New 2.8 Craftsmanship
- Old 2.8 Metallurgy → New 2.9 Metallurgy
- Old 2.9 Military → New 2.10 Military
- Old 2.10 Counting → New 2.11 Counting
- Old 2.11 Measurement → New 2.12 Measurement
- Old 2.12 Flow → New 2.13 Flow
- Old 2.13 Advanced → New 2.14 Advanced

All corresponding Figure and Table numbers updated accordingly.

### 5. ✅ Updated Organization List (Section 1.3)
**Line 111:** Added Stone Age Technology to chronological sequence:

```markdown
1. Early Human Society (人 女 母 娘 好 妇) - Biological foundation
2. Nature Observation (金 木 水 火 土 日 月 星) - Cosmology formation
3. Stone Age Technology (石 岩 矿 斫 破 砍 泵) - Primitive civilization  [NEW]
4. Hunting & Domestication (犬 器 哭 豕 家 牛 马 初) - Animal relationships
5. Cutting & Inscribing (乂 匕 文 刀 力) - Tool inventions
...
14. Advanced Concepts (尧 烧 晓 艮 屰 鬲) - Philosophical abstraction
```

---

## Previously Completed (v0.3)

### Character Count Updates (78 → 80)
- Updated all references from 78 to 80 semantic radicals
- Added 妇 (fù - married woman) to Section 2.1
- Added 汞 (gǒng - mercury) to Section 2.13 (now 2.14)
- Updated figures-config.yaml with both characters

### "(unavailable)" Explanation
- Added comprehensive footnote after Figure 2.1 (line 203)
- Explains three scenarios: post-dates period, images not public, not yet discovered
- Clarifies absence doesn't invalidate semantic analysis

---

## Summary of v0.4 Improvements

### Intellectual Contribution
- **Section 3.3** elevates paper from descriptive etymology to **cognitive archaeology**
- Characters preserve not just observations but **analytical reasoning frameworks**
- Demonstrates how ancient people modeled causation across physical, social, and abstract domains

### Diplomatic Positioning
- **"Building Upon Traditional Scholarship"** section improves East Asian academic reception
- Frames work as continuation of 1,900-year scholarly tradition, not rejection
- Acknowledges Xu Shen's methodological soundness while explaining evidentiary limitations

### Chronological Completeness
- **Stone Age Technology section** fills gap between Nature Observation and Hunting
- Demonstrates material foundations that enabled all subsequent technological development
- Validates systematic material knowledge encoding from Neolithic through Bronze Age

### Total Sections: 14 civilization stages (vs. 13 in v0.3)
### Total Character Count: 87 characters (80 core + 7 new Stone Age examples)

## Next Steps for Future Versions

### ✅ Gemini Feedback #3: Scope Clarification - COMPLETED
**Status:** Appendix section added with two subsections

#### Appendix A: Complete 400-Primitive Inventory (PLACEHOLDER)
- Table structure defined for all 400 elemental characters from ZiNets
- Categorization framework for remaining ~320 primitives:
  - Post-Bronze Age abstractions (~70)
  - Phonetic-dominant compounds (~150)
  - Regional/dialectal variants (~50)
  - Pending archaeological evidence (~50)
- Cross-reference with Richard Sears database, Shuowen, Kangxi
- Purpose: transparency, completeness, future research priorities
- **TO BE POPULATED:** Awaiting complete ZiNets character list from user

#### Appendix B: Epistemological Limitations
- Philosophical acknowledgment of cognitive reconstruction boundaries
- "What We CAN Know" vs. "What We CANNOT Know"
- Methodological analogy with paleoclimatology, paleontology, comparative linguistics
- Confidence levels and validation standards (network coherence, oracle attestation, archaeological corroboration)
- Intellectual humility statement
- **The "Digging for Gold" metaphor** - captures research epistemology perfectly
- Demonstrates scholarly rigor while maintaining empirical strength

### Potential Future Enhancements
- Expand Stone Age section with more oracle bone evidence as discovered
- Add conceptual figures (pit trap diagrams, spoke wheel engineering, etc.)
- Cross-reference Section 3.3 examples with Section 2 case studies
- Develop pedagogical supplement using periodic table approach
