### B. Epistemological Limitations: The Boundaries of Cognitive Reconstruction

Our analysis reconstructs ancient cognitive frameworks through compositional inference, semantic network coherence validation, and archaeological corroboration. However, we acknowledge fundamental **epistemological constraints** that bound any attempt to recover ancient thought processes across three millennia.

#### What We CAN Know (with high confidence):

1. **Structural existence**: The character compositions demonstrably exist (矿/礦 = 石 + 广 + 黄, 江 = 氵+ 工, 家 = 宀 + 豕)

2. **Network coherence**: Semantic radicals maintain 80-95% coherence across derived character families, validated through systematic analysis of 50-250 characters per radical

3. **Archaeological alignment**: Material culture evidence corroborates the practices encoded (pit trap hunting, pig domestication, bronze smelting, jade working, spoke wheel technology)

4. **Systematic patterns**: Compositional logic operates consistently across physical, social, and abstract domains, suggesting deliberate analytical encoding rather than arbitrary assignment

5. **Functional continuity**: Characters preserve ancient semantic structure while remaining actively used in modern communication (3,200+ years continuous usage)

#### What We CANNOT Know (epistemological inaccessibility):

1. **Historical moment of creation**: We cannot observe the exact time, place, or circumstances when specific characters were first created

2. **Creator's conscious intent**: We cannot interview ancient character creators to verify whether compositional patterns were consciously designed or emerged through evolutionary refinement

3. **Individual vs. collective authorship**: Despite the Cangjie (倉頡) legend, we cannot determine whether characters were invented by individuals, evolved through community consensus, or represent accumulated scribal wisdom across generations

4. **Deliberate design vs. evolutionary accumulation**: While systematic patterns suggest intentional analytical encoding, we cannot definitively distinguish conscious design from gradual convergence through usage refinement

5. **Complete cognitive context**: We lack direct access to the full conceptual frameworks, cultural assumptions, and practical knowledge systems that surrounded character usage in Shang Dynasty society

#### Methodological Analogy: Inference Across Time

Our reconstruction methodology parallels other sciences that infer past conditions from preserved evidence:

- **Paleoclimatology**: Infers ancient climate from ice cores, tree rings, sediment layers—no direct observation, but high-confidence reconstruction
- **Paleontology**: Reconstructs extinct species behavior from fossil evidence—systematic patterns support behavioral inferences
- **Comparative linguistics**: Reconstructs Proto-Indo-European from daughter languages—systematic correspondences validate reconstruction
- **Archaeology**: Infers social organization from burial patterns, settlement layouts—material evidence supports social models

Similarly, we infer ancient cognitive frameworks from character structure—**evidence-based reconstruction**, not time-travel certainty.

#### Confidence Levels and Validation Standards

Our confidence in specific interpretations correlates with:

1. **Network coherence scores**: 95%+ coherence (艮 visibility) = highest confidence; 80-85% (certain late compounds) = moderate confidence

2. **Oracle bone attestation**: Direct Shang Dynasty evidence (石, 犬, 工) = highest confidence; later seal script only (矿, 破) = moderate confidence requiring network validation

3. **Archaeological corroboration**: Multiple independent material evidence sources (jade working + quarry sites + tool debris) = higher confidence than single source

4. **Cross-domain consistency**: When the same analytical pattern appears across multiple domains (technology → value pathway in 良, 文, 工) = higher confidence in systematic encoding

5. **Alternative explanation exclusion**: When semantic network coherence strongly favors one interpretation over traditional glosses (艮 as "visibility" 95% vs. Shuowen's "stiff/hard" <20%) = higher confidence in reinterpretation

#### Intellectual Humility Statement

We present **high-probability reconstructions** (80-95% network coherence thresholds), not absolute certainties about ancient thought. The systematicity of compositional patterns (矿/礦 encoding WHERE + WHAT prospecting knowledge, 江 encoding water performing work, 家 encoding domestication as civilization marker) suggests deliberate analytical encoding, but the **exact cognitive process** behind character creation remains epistemologically inaccessible.

What we can confidently assert: **Ancient character creators demonstrated sophisticated analytical reasoning** in decomposing complex phenomena into causal components and encoding these relationships compositionally. Whether this sophistication emerged through individual genius (Cangjie legend), institutional design (state coordination hypothesis), or collective wisdom accumulation (scribal community refinement), the **analytical sophistication itself is undeniable** and preserved in character structure.

#### The "Digging for Gold" Metaphor

Like prospectors mining yellow stones in wilderness cannot know the geological history that created the ore deposits, we "dig for gold in Chinese characters" without complete knowledge of the cognitive history that created the compositional structures. **But the gold is real**—the preserved knowledge, the systematic patterns, the analytical sophistication are empirically demonstrable through network coherence methodology and archaeological corroboration.

Our contribution is not claiming to perfectly reconstruct ancient minds, but rather demonstrating that Chinese characters **function as cognitive fossils**—preserving analytical frameworks that remain systematically readable despite the epistemological gap across three millennia.
